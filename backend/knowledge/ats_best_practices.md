# ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Best Practices

## What is ATS?
An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is software used by employers to filter, scan, and rank job applications. Over 98% of Fortune 500 companies and 75% of all employers use ATS software. Understanding how ATS works is critical for job seekers to ensure their resumes pass the initial automated screening.

## Resume Formatting for ATS

### File Format
- PDF is the most universally accepted format for ATS
- Avoid using images, graphics, or tables that cannot be parsed by ATS
- Use standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, or Garamond
- Font size should be between 10-12pt for body text, 14-16pt for headings

### Document Structure
- Use a single-column layout for maximum ATS compatibility
- Avoid headers and footers as many ATS systems cannot read them
- Use standard section headings: "Professional Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Summary"
- Avoid creative section names like "My Journey" or "What I Bring to the Table"
- Use reverse chronological order for experience and education

### Text Formatting
- Use standard bullet points (•, -, or *) not custom symbols
- Avoid text boxes, shapes, or WordArt
- Do not use columns or multi-column layouts
- Avoid images, logos, or icons embedded in the resume
- Keep consistent formatting throughout the document

## Content Optimization

### Contact Information
- Include full name, phone number, email, LinkedIn URL, and location (city, state)
- Place contact information at the top of the resume, not in headers/footers
- Use a professional email address

### Professional Summary
- Include a 2-3 sentence professional summary at the top
- Incorporate key industry terms and the target job title
- Highlight most relevant qualifications and years of experience
- Avoid using first person pronouns

### Work Experience
- Use the format: Job Title | Company Name | Location | Date Range
- Include 3-6 bullet points per position
- Start each bullet point with a strong action verb
- Quantify achievements with numbers, percentages, and dollar amounts
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for bullet points
- Include relevant keywords from the job description naturally

### Skills Section
- List both hard skills and soft skills
- Include technical skills, software proficiency, certifications
- Use the exact terminology from job descriptions
- Group skills by category (Technical, Languages, Tools, etc.)
- Include 8-15 relevant skills

### Education
- Include degree, institution name, graduation date
- Add GPA if above 3.5 (for recent graduates)
- Include relevant coursework, honors, and certifications
- List education after experience (unless recent graduate)

## Keyword Optimization

### Importance of Keywords
- ATS systems scan for specific keywords from the job description
- Match keywords exactly as they appear in the job posting
- Include both spelled-out terms and acronyms (e.g., "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)")
- Use keywords naturally throughout the resume, not just in a keyword list

### Types of Keywords to Include
- Job titles and alternative titles
- Technical skills and technologies
- Industry-specific terminology
- Certifications and licenses
- Software and tools
- Methodologies and frameworks
- Action verbs relevant to the field

### Keyword Placement Strategy
- Place the most important keywords in the top third of the resume
- Include keywords in the professional summary, skills section, and experience descriptions
- Use keywords multiple times (2-3 times) naturally throughout the document
- Don't stuff keywords unnaturally - ATS algorithms detect keyword stuffing

## Common ATS Mistakes to Avoid
1. Using creative or non-standard formatting
2. Submitting resumes as images or scanned documents
3. Using PDF files that are image-based rather than text-based
4. Putting important information in headers or footers
5. Using abbreviations without spelling them out first
6. Having spelling or grammar errors
7. Using generic skill descriptions instead of specific ones
8. Failing to customize the resume for each job application
9. Including irrelevant work experience
10. Making the resume too long (over 2 pages for most positions)

## ATS Scoring Factors
The ATS typically scores resumes based on the following factors, weighted by importance:

1. **Keyword Match (40%)**: How well the resume keywords match the job description
2. **Skills Relevance (20%)**: How relevant the listed skills are to the position
3. **Experience Quality (15%)**: Quantified achievements and relevant experience
4. **Education Match (10%)**: Alignment of educational background with requirements
5. **Formatting Compliance (10%)**: How well-structured and parseable the resume format is
6. **Overall Completeness (5%)**: Presence of all expected resume sections

## Resume Length Guidelines
- Entry-level / Early career (0-5 years): 1 page
- Mid-career (5-15 years): 1-2 pages
- Senior / Executive (15+ years): 2 pages maximum
- Academic / Research CVs: No strict limit, but be concise
