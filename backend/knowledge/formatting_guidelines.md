# Resume Formatting Guidelines for Maximum ATS Compatibility

## Document Structure Hierarchy

### Optimal Section Order (for experienced professionals)
1. Contact Information
2. Professional Summary / Career Objective
3. Core Competencies / Key Skills
4. Professional Experience
5. Education
6. Certifications & Professional Development
7. Additional Skills / Languages / Volunteer Work

### Optimal Section Order (for recent graduates)
1. Contact Information
2. Education
3. Relevant Coursework / Academic Projects
4. Internship / Work Experience
5. Skills
6. Certifications / Activities / Honors

## Section Heading Standards

### Recommended Section Headings
These headings are most reliably parsed by ATS systems:
- "Professional Summary" or "Summary"
- "Professional Experience" or "Work Experience" or "Experience"
- "Education" or "Educational Background"
- "Skills" or "Technical Skills" or "Core Competencies"
- "Certifications" or "Certifications & Licenses"
- "Projects" or "Key Projects"
- "Volunteer Experience" or "Community Involvement"

### Headings to Avoid
- "About Me" - use "Professional Summary"
- "What I Do" - use "Professional Experience"
- "My Toolbox" - use "Technical Skills"
- "Places I've Worked" - use "Work Experience"
- "Learned Stuff" - use "Education"

## Visual Formatting Rules

### Typography
- Use one consistent font throughout
- Recommended fonts: Arial, Calibri, Garamond, Cambria, Helvetica, Times New Roman
- Body text: 10-12pt
- Section headings: 12-14pt, bold
- Name: 16-20pt
- Minimum line spacing: 1.0, recommended: 1.15
- Use bold for emphasis, not italics or underline (ATS may misread)

### Spacing and Margins
- Margins: 0.5" to 1" on all sides
- Consistent spacing between sections (12-18pt)
- No more than 2 blank lines between any sections
- Adequate white space for readability

### Bullet Points
- Use standard bullet characters: •, -, or standard list formatting
- Keep bullet points to 1-2 lines each
- Start each bullet with an action verb
- Include 3-6 bullets per job position
- Be concise: aim for 10-20 words per bullet

## Date Formatting
- Use consistent date format throughout
- Recommended formats: "Jan 2020 - Present", "01/2020 - Present", "January 2020 - Present"
- Include month and year, not just year
- Use "Present" for current positions
- Avoid date ranges that leave gaps (explain gaps if they exist)

## File Format Specifications
- Save as PDF for best compatibility (text-based, not scanned image)
- Ensure the PDF is searchable (select text test)
- File name format: "FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf"
- Keep file size under 5MB
- Avoid password-protecting the PDF

## Parsing-Friendly Practices
- Use straight quotes, not curly/smart quotes
- Avoid special characters: ©, ™, ®, fancy dashes
- Use standard hyphens and dashes
- Use standard email format: name@domain.com
- Include country code with phone numbers: +1 (555) 123-4567
- Spell out state names or use standard 2-letter abbreviations
