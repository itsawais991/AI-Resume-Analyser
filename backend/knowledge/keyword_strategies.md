# Resume Keyword Strategies for ATS Optimization

## Understanding ATS Keyword Matching

### Exact Match vs Semantic Match
- Most ATS systems use exact keyword matching algorithms
- Advanced ATS (like Taleo, Workday, Lever) also use semantic matching
- Always include exact keywords from the job posting for maximum compatibility
- Supplement with related terms and synonyms for semantic matching

### Keyword Density
- Optimal keyword density: 2-4% of total resume text
- Avoid exceeding 5% as this may trigger keyword stuffing filters
- Place high-priority keywords in the first third of the resume
- Distribute keywords naturally across all resume sections
